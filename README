TorchBurn

I've thought for awhile now that it's rather silly you can place torches all day long, 
but can't do something as simple as carry one around. This plugin adds that functionality to MineCraft.


Features and Functionality:
. Using a torch 'lights' the torch for one minute, during which you can carry it around as a light source.
. To use a torch, sneak (hold shift), then right-click in the air (so as not to place it) with the torch in-hand.
. Hitting a creature or player with the torch will set it on fire for five seconds.
. Torches have an indicator that will 'tick down' as the torch expires.
. By default, torches will go out when you submerge in water or lava
. Dropping a lit torch in any way will immediately extinguish it and the torch will be lost.
. Lit torches cannot be placed.
